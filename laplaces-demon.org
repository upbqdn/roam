Neo, the main character from The Matrix, didn't like the idea of fate because he
wanted to be able to make his own choices. Let's see what Pierre-Simon Laplace
had to say about such free will back in 1814.

At the turn of the 17th and 18th century, Isaac Newton published a work in three
books called /Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (The Mathematical
Principles of Natural Philosophy)/ [cite:@principia] or simply /Principia/.
There, he originally wrote:

#+begin_quote
/Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri
secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur./
#+end_quote

Which we can translate into English as follows:

#+begin_quote
/The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the
body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed./
#+end_quote

We can express this idea mathematically as $p' = F$, where $p'$ is the time
derivative of momentum $p$ and $F$ is the force which represents the impulse
that Newton referred to. Since momentum $p$ is defined as $p = mv$, where $m$ is
the mass of the body and $v$ is its velocity (the time derivative of position
$x$, i.e. $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$), we can take the derivative of momentum with
respect to time: $F = \frac{dp}{dt} = m\frac{dv}{dt} = ma$, where $a$ is the
acceleration of the body (the time derivative of velocity, i.e.
$a = \frac{dv}{dt}$). This is known as Newton's second law of motion. If we need
to consider various directions of the force $F$ and acceleration $a$, we can use
vectors $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$. Newton also proposed the concept of derivatives so
that we can actually solve and use the equations above. These ideas give us a
very strong apparatus for calculating the movements of physical objects. If we
have an abstract system of physical objects, and we know the initial forces,
positions, and velocities of all the objects, then we exactly know how the
system will behave in the future. Moreover, we don't even need to know the
initial properties; if we measure them at any time, we can calculate the past as
well as the future. In other words, there's no place for any random accident in
the moving process. That's also what Newton's second law tells us, and that's
what Laplace noticed approximately 100 years later.

We will now need the term /determinism/. When we have a deterministic system, it
means that the current state exactly predicts the next one. If the Universe were
deterministic, it would mean that our destiny would be exactly predicted. This
is also what Einstein believed, and that is why he said that "God does not play
dice" when he was trying to show that the apparent randomness in quantum
mechanics must have hidden deterministic variables underneath.

As far as we know, our Universe consists of elementary particles, and everything
started with the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. That means that the initial
conditions were apparently given, and if the elementary particles behaved
according to Newton's laws, the Universe would probably be fully deterministic.
This idea is known as Laplace's demon, a concept he outlined in his work named
/A philosophical essay on probabilities/ [cite:@laplace] in 1814:

#+begin_quote
/We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and
the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all
forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature
is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to
analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest
bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect
nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present
before its eyes./ [cite:@laplace]
#+end_quote

When meteorologists got their first computers in the early 1960s, they thought
that they would be able to make exact weather forecasts for a very long time.
Unfortunately, it turned out that this is a very difficult task. Even though the
weather is a deterministic system without any random elements involved, it is not
easily predictable. This fact was explored by Edward Lorenz in 1961 when he was
simulating weather evolution on a computer. After a very slight change in the
input values, the simulated evolution was completely different. This is known as
the Butterfly effect, after a talk Lorenz gave titled /Does the flap of a
butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?/
[cite:@lorenz-butterfly] The same sensitivity to initial conditions applies
every time you throw dice, and that's why we are not able to predict the weather
for more than a few days even with the most advanced technology we have today.
However, the Butterfly effect doesn't weaken Laplace's demon; it only creates
so-called deterministic chaos. Lorenz summarized it in one sentence: /Chaos:
When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not
approximately determine the future./ [cite:@lorenz-chaos]

Quantum theory is perhaps the strongest challenge to the demon. It claims that
the subatomic world behaves according to the laws of quantum mechanics and not
Newton's laws. This means, inter alia, that certain properties of particles do
not have definite values until they are measured — we can only calculate the
probability of obtaining a given value. This is not due to poor technology. It is
because it is impossible in principle. One of the reasons for this is
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It states that the more precisely we know the
position of any particle, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice
versa. This is not a limitation of measurement — it reflects a fundamental
property of nature. Under the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics,
conjugate properties like position and momentum simply cannot both be precisely
defined at the same time. However, whether this means the details genuinely
don't exist (as the Copenhagen interpretation holds) or are merely inaccessible
to any observer (as hidden-variable theories suggest) remains debated. Either
way, quantum theory shows us that there cannot be any "intelligent entity"
inside our Universe which would know the exact state of all particles and which
would be able to calculate the future or the past.

Stephen Hawking also applied his mind to the question of whether God plays dice
or not. [cite:@hawking-dice] The concept of black holes had been known for
decades, and any mass or energy which falls into a black hole is lost forever
without any chance to escape, so information in the Universe is lost. However,
Hawking proved that black holes are not entirely so black and that they do send
out particles at a steady rate. These particles don't come directly from the
black hole, but are created in pairs near the event horizon. During this
creation, a whole pair can escape or be absorbed, but also one particle from a
pair can escape while the other is absorbed. This vaporization reduces the size
of the black hole, and in the end, the black hole disappears. Crucially, there
is no way to predict the speed and position of the escaped particle without
knowing about the absorbed one. This seemed to be the obvious funeral of
Laplace's demon; but in 2005, Hawking conceded that black holes may after all
preserve information about what fell into them — though this rescues information
conservation, not determinism itself.

What would it mean if we thought about the Universe being deterministic? The
philosophical consequences are surprisingly fascinating. There wouldn't be any
place for uncertainty or accident; everything would have its reason. That seems
fine, everything is explainable, but when we think more deeply, it gets
terrifying and emotionally frustrating. It would be worse than the Matrix for
Neo because there wouldn't be any difference between living beings and machines.
Our every step or thought would have been strictly set 13.8 billion years ago.
Ethics, good and evil, or responsibility would be just illusions. There wouldn't
be any difference between life and lifeless; everything would be just a soulless
result of moving atoms. We would be just actors on the stage of a big theater
with no influence or chance to change anything. On the other hand, we might feel
comfortable because it would give us certainty that we can't mess up anything.
If you got arrested for drinking and driving, you could argue that it was not
your responsibility. You could say that elementary particles were responsible and
you couldn't do anything. Also, when we fall in love with somebody and it seems
like an accident, we can only be thankful that the tiny particles decided to
move in the right direction 13.8 billion years ago.

What about God? What is interesting is that people who believe in God may argue
against a deterministic Universe. If God did create this theater, we could
assume that he gave us freedom of will. Otherwise it would have been boring for
him to observe us during such an artificial performance. And even if God really
does not play dice, let's keep our free will and thoughts and let's hope that
they're really not just an illusion. Science has given rise to the demon and
hopefully it will also destroy it.
