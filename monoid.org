<<.def-r>> *[[.def-r][Definition r]]*. A *monoid* is a set $M$ with a [[id:binary-operation][binary operation]]
$\left( a, b \right) \mapsto a \circ b$ such that the following two axioms hold:
1. Associativity: $\left( a \circ b \right) \circ c = a \circ \left( b \circ c \right)$ for all
   $a, b, c \in M$.
2. Identity: There is an *identity element* $e \in M$ such that $e \circ a = a \circ e =
   a$ for all $a \in M$.
A monoid is a *commutative monoid* if, in addition to 1. and 2., the following
axiom also holds:
3. [@3] Commutativity: $a \circ b = b \circ a$ for all $a, b \in M$.

<<.rem-k>> *[[.rem-k][Remark k]]*.
1. Since $\circ$ is a binary operation, the resulting element, $a \circ b$ is always in
   $M$ for all $a , b \in M$. We say that $M$ is closed under $\circ$ or that $\circ$ is
   closed on $M$.
2. For simplicity, we usually refer to the set $M$ as the monoid with the
   associated operation being implicit. We use this convention for other
   algebraic structures as well, even when there are multiple operations
   associated with the structure.
3. We usually refer to the identity element as the identity.
