#+BEGIN_df
<<.df-m>> *[[.df-m][Definition m]]*. Let \(R\) be a commutative [[id:ring][ring]] and \(\emptyset \ne I \subseteq R\). Then
\(I\) is an *ideal* of \(R\) if:
1. The sum \(a + b\) is in \(I\) for all \(a, b \in I\).
2. The product \(ar\) is in \(I\) for all \(a \in I\) and \(r \in R\).
The ideal \(I\) is *proper* if \(I \ne R\).

#+BEGIN_rem
<<.rem-c>> *[[.rem-c][Remark c]]*. [[.df-m][Definition m]] says that if \(R\) is a commutative [[id:ring][ring]],
and \(\emptyset \neq I \subseteq R\), then \(I\) is an [[.df-m][ideal]] of \(R\) if:
1. The set \(I\) is closed under addition.
2. The set \(I\) is closed under multiplication by any \(r \in R\).

#+BEGIN_pr
<<.pr-p>> *[[.pr-p][Proposition p]]*. Let \(I\) be an [[.df-m][ideal]] of a commutative [[id:ring][ring]] \(R\).
Then:
1. The equation \(a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0\) holds for all \(a \in R\).
2. The element \(0\) is in \(I\).
3. If \(1 \in I\) then \(I\) is not proper.
