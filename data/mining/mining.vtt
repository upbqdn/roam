Okay, hey everyone, this video is an attempt to show how I operate three Z15 machines to

00:10.200 --> 00:12.200
mine Zcash.

00:12.200 --> 00:17.140
If this beast lets me do it.

00:17.140 --> 00:28.280
So we're in the basement of a family house and here we have three Z15 machines immersed

00:28.280 --> 00:39.520
in oil and the one on the left or on the right mined the first block using Zebra.

00:39.520 --> 00:46.340
The one in the middle didn't work at that time because one of the ASICs burned and needed

00:46.340 --> 00:47.460
to be removed.

00:47.460 --> 00:59.500
You can see a missing heat sink there and each miner has three hashboards and each hashboard

00:59.500 --> 01:06.600
has three ASICs and together they generate 4.5 kilowatts of heat.

01:06.600 --> 01:17.220
You can sort of see the oil shimmering there and the hot oil enters the hole and it runs

01:17.220 --> 01:28.740
through this pipe and this pump to this heat exchanger between oil and water and then the

01:28.740 --> 01:39.380
cold oil enters the enclosure at the bottom.

01:39.380 --> 01:49.860
The other side of the exchanger is connected to the central heating in the house and the

01:49.860 --> 02:02.620
cold water from the central heating runs through this pump and pipe and enters the exchanger

02:02.620 --> 02:11.640
at the bottom and then the hot water runs out to this barrel which is an electric heater

02:11.640 --> 02:20.820
that can be used as a backup and then the hot water runs up into the radiators.

02:20.820 --> 02:27.580
The mess on the wall is just from welding the pipes up there.

02:27.580 --> 02:34.960
The hot water also enters a water tank through this pump and the water tank provides hot

02:34.960 --> 02:41.160
water for the house.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.580
Here we have an electric box.

02:44.580 --> 02:54.500
Massive kudos to my brother who came up with it and also made it and also who made most

02:54.500 --> 03:06.480
of the plumbing and many important details such as these metal rods that can adjust the

03:06.480 --> 03:14.100
height of the enclosure by just twisting them.

03:14.100 --> 03:27.100
They are welded to the construction supporting the enclosure and we use them to set the level

03:27.100 --> 03:30.440
of the surface of the oil.

03:30.440 --> 03:37.420
The electric box contains this single board computer.

03:37.420 --> 03:43.160
The green heartbeat means that everything is good.

03:43.160 --> 03:53.320
The computer scrapes the temperatures of the ASICs from the web interfaces of the miners

03:53.320 --> 04:06.580
and uses the maximum temperature to prevent overheating of the miners by opening this

04:06.580 --> 04:11.100
valve.

04:11.100 --> 04:18.840
When the valve is open the hot water starts running down the garden hose that we used

04:18.840 --> 04:24.700
because we didn't have anything else at that time but it seems to be working well.

04:24.700 --> 04:36.560
The water then goes into this industrial heater and the computer also turns on this fan and

04:36.560 --> 04:48.320
the excess heat then runs up an old chimney.

04:48.320 --> 04:58.760
The last bit is the solar system that uses this 15 kilowatt hour battery that is connected

04:58.760 --> 05:05.280
to this solar inverter.

05:05.280 --> 05:13.160
The power of the solar panels connected to the inverter is 15 kilowatts which is the

05:13.160 --> 05:22.700
maximum that the inverter can take and it helps to offset the consumption of this whole

05:22.700 --> 05:25.400
thing and that's all about it.
